#Problem - 1 


#Write a program to display the Fibonacci sequence up to n-th term. The program should prompt the user for the number of terms.
#Note that a Fibonacci sequence is the integer sequence of 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.... The first two terms are 0 and 1. All other 
#terms are obtained by adding the preceding two terms.



#Providing the number of terms I want to consider 
n = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))

#Opening a blank loop for keeping the terms of Fibonacci Sequance 
x = []


#Looping over the range of temrs so that I can preapre the series 
for i in range (n):  
    if i == 0:
        x.append(0)
    elif i== 1:
        x.append(1)
    else:
        x.append(x[i-2] + x[i-1])
 
#Print the entire series in a form of list s 
print (x); 


#Problem - 2 

#The payroll department keeps a list of employee information for each pay period in a text file named payroll.txt. The format of each line of the file is as follows:
#< name > < hourlywage > < hoursworked >
#Write a program that inputs the filename: payroll.txt from the user and prints to the terminal a report of the wages paid to the employees for the given period. 
#The report should be in tabular format with the appropriate header. Each line should contain an employeeâ€™s name, the hours worked, and the wages paid for that period. You can find payroll.txt in Assignment #2 on Canvas.

#importing prettytable for creating the table 
from prettytable import PrettyTable
#Giving the name of file in the program
file = input("Enter the file name you want to consider for calculation: ")

#Opeing the file in reading mode
fr = open(file, "r")

#Printing the header
t = PrettyTable(["Name", "Hourly Wages", "Hours Worked","Total Pay"])


#Looping over the text file for doing calculation of wages 
for line in fr.readlines():

    cols = line.strip().split()
    t.add_row([cols[0],float(cols[1]),float(cols[2]), (float(cols[1]) * float(cols[2]))])


#printing the tablular formated result 
print(t)

#Closing the file after the calculation 
fr.close() 



#Problem - 3



#Write a program that prompts the user for the names of two text files including: myfile1.txt and myfile2.txt. The contents of the first file, myfile1.txt, 
#should be input and written to the second file, myfile2.txt. You can find myfile1.txt in Assignment #2 on Canvas.



#Taking the name of the first file from where the sencond file will read the data 
file1 = input("Enter the file name you want to copy from: ")

#Opeing the first text file in reading mode 
fr1 = open(file1, "r")

#Taking the name of second file which will be created and keep the data of first file
file2 = input("Enter the file name you want to write: ")

#Opening the second file in writing mode so that we can wirte in it from the first file. 
fw = open(file2, "w")


#Looping over the first file for writing in the second file 
for line in fr1:
    fw.write(line)
  
#Closing the second file so that I can re-open it for reading 
fw.close()

#Reopeing the second file in reading mode, because when the file in writing mode, it can't read the file. 
f = open(file2, "r")

#Looping over the second file for printing as well as checking is it running or not. 
for l in f:
    print(l)
    
#Closing the running files 
f.close()
fr1.close()
